# Explaination
## E0 Probability Algorithm For AI
```python
def probability(um, rw, schat=False, req=[]):
    count = 0
    hw = True
    for w in um:
        if w in rw:
            count += 1
    per = float(count) / float(len(rw))
    for w in req:
        if w not in um:
            hw = False
            break
    if hw or schat:
        return int(per * 100)
    else:
        return 0
```
## E1 Packet
This packet for advice codes and if there any result for message. It will write `I didnt understand sorry... Please reply.` or something.
```py
import random
advicelist = ["You can Improve my code. Its so simple...","You can play a game...","You may learn new programming language...","You can star my github repo."]
gamelist = ["Fortnite","Valorant","Far Cry 5","GTA V","Tomb Rider","Control","Far Cry 6","Snake Game","Football","Basketball"]
R_EATING = "Ummm... You may eat pasta. But my favorite foods are : CPU and RAM. They are awsome. You must try!"
R_ADVICE = random.choice(advicelist)
R_GAME = random.choice(gamelist)

def unknown():
    response = ["Could you please re-phrase that? ",
                "...",
                "I didnt understand sorry... Please reply.",
                "Sounds about right.",
                "What does that mean?"][
        random.randrange(5)]
    return response
```

## Data base :

Explaination : if user writed : hi after that bot will say `Hello!` Because `hi` is in 
`['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'sup', 'heyo','hola','salam','merhaba']` list. It works like this

```py
    dns('Hello!', ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'sup', 'heyo','hola','salam','merhaba','selam','السلام عليكم','عليكم','السلام'], schat=True)
    dns('See you!', ['bye', 'goodbye'], schat=True)

            Hi ? Are you there ? Ok... I will say 
            story. I created by Error. His other 
            name is TheSadError. He created my on 
            5 May 2022 . He used python3.9 . And he 
            added E1 packet for unknown things. It 
            working awsomely. And I am open source. 
            This means you can see my code and can edit
            them for yourself. For this Error shared 
            my code in his own github repo. Let me explain
            E0 logic. Logic : 
            User input a sentence or words probability
            function searching for probability. Which words 
            probability suitability is bigger in database
            E0 prints answear of the word base. Its simple AI.
